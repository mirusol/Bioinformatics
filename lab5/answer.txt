DNA Sequence Reconstruction Algorithm Analysis

Core Algorithm Issues:
   - The algorithm uses random sampling which can lead to uneven coverage
   - No consideration for sequence quality or error rates
   - Simple consensus approach may fail with complex repeats
   - No handling of reverse complementary sequences

Assembly Challenges:
   - No overlap detection between fragments
   - Missing error correction mechanisms
   - Difficulty with repetitive DNA regions

Computational Constraints:
   - Memory usage grows linearly with sequence length
   - Simple reconstruction may not scale well for longer sequences
   - No parallelization implementation
   - Storage overhead for sample tracking

Biological Considerations:
   - No accounting for GC content bias
   - No consideration for known problematic sequences

Statistical Limitations:
   - Random sampling may not be truly representative
